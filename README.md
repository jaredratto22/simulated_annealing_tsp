# simulated_annealing_tsp
Simulated annealing is an optimization algorithm that evaluates one solution at a time. It has been successfully applied for many real world problems but it can be difficult to use because the algorithm is very dependent on its parameters being correctly tuned. The two main parameters are setting the initial temperature and the cooling schedule. This notebook explores tuning both of those parameters and compares the results of my algorithm to stochastic hill-climber and simple random search algorithms for 5 Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) problems.

Finding the initial temperature parameter can be a complex topic. To do this, I implemented an [algorithm proposed by Walid Ben-Ameur](https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/8a3521ca-3e4d-362e-86d6-0d2aad69f398/) (see steps on page 374) in Python. Some experimentation might be needed to find the parameter S that is used in this algorithm. I provided a couple functions that may make finding S a little easier.
